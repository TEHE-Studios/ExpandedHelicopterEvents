### Welcome
If you are new to translating in project Zomboid take a moment to note that everything is labeled based on language codes or IDs. 
- For example, English is EN, Spanish is ES, Russian is RU.


### To Contribute
- Add a folder with matching contents as another folder.
- Replace the language ID in the file name and file contents.
- Translate the text.
- You will have to encode your text files with the proper encoding. Let me know if you're not sure how to do this.
